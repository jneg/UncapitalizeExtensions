# UncapitalizeExtensions
A bash script to uncapitalize all extensions recursively

Run the script with the full starting directory path and the extension name in lowercase.
Make sure you have permissions in that directory and its subdirectories, or the mv command will fail.

Example:
uncapextensions.sh /path/to/StartingDirectory ext
uncapextensions.sh "/home/Michelangelo/My Books" pdf
